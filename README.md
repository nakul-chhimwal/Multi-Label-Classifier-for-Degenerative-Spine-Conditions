# Multi-Label-Classifier-for-Degenerative-Spine-Conditions

Low Back pain is the leading cause of disability globally, affecting 619 million people in 2020 (WHO).
Degeneration of vertebral discs, narrowing of the spinal canal and compression of nerves leads to pain and restricted mobility.
Early detection and classification of these conditions using MRI enables proper treatment planning, improving patient health and
quality of life.
Current manual diagnosis methods are time-consuming, prone to subjective interpretation, and require expert knowledge.

This project focuses on developing a multi-label classifier to identify and classify degenerative spine conditions from MRI scans.
Conditions such as foraminal narrowing, subarticular stenosis, and canal stenosis will be identified, withseverity labeled as normal/mild, moderate, or severe across the five lumbar spine levels (L1-L5).
The goal is to automate the detection of these conditions, improve diagnostic accuracy, and assist healthcare professionals in making quicker treatment decisions based on MRI scans.
